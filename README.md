# Meson + Ninja Build System

MesonÂ® is a project to create the best possible next-generation build system.
Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.

## Build this library

To build this library, you will need:

* [GNU Windows](https://github.com/tfslabs/gnu-windows)
* [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/) version 3 or newer installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website and follow their installation instructions.
* [Python 3.9+](https://python.org)

> :warning:
>
> * Make sure you can run `make`, `gcc`  and `g++` from the command line without any issues.
> * DO NOT install Python3 from Microsoft Store, due to various problems on the installation

Just run the  following commands in a terminal window to get started:

```cmd
build.bat
```

Once it's done, you can see your `.bin` folder. You can then paste it into your GNU Windows installation folder.
